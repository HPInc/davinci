This example demonstrate the initialisation of a very basic API based on [Hono](https://hono.dev/)

While Hono is commonly employed at the edge, its platform-independent nature allows it to be integrated into any JavaScript runtime.

Explore three different Hono implementations:
1. Within a Node.js runtime setting ([link](src/entry-node.ts))
2. On an edge runtime platform ([link](src/entry-edge.ts))
3. Within the AWS Lambda serverless framework ([link](src/entry-lambda.ts))
