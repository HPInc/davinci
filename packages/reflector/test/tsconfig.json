Loosen locknut (2) on the governor actuator side of governor spring (1).

(3) Turn governor spring (1) clockwise to decrease installed length (a) and return governor lever (3) of the fuel injection pump to a position where it will not touch the full stopper.

(4) Turn governor spring (1) counterclockwise to increase installed length (a) and stop it when governor lever (3) of the fuel injection pump touches the full stopper. Standard installed length (a) (Reference): 259.9 mm

(5) Turn governor spring (1) counterclockwise further by 2.5 turns to shorten the internal spring of governor spring (1).

Since the internal spring is shortened, only the outer cylinder of governor spring (1) moves about 3.1 mm toward the fuel injection pump (The installed length does not change).

(6) With governor spring (1) fixed, tighten locknut (2) on the governor actuator side. Before fixing the locknut, check that the water drain hole of the governor spring is directed down. If the water drain hole is not directed down, loosen locknut (4) on the fuel injection
